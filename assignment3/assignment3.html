                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>
                    In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks,
                    whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called
                    roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[9] Castrated roosters are called capons
                    (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year
                    old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[10] although in the egg-laying industry, a
                    pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New
                    Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and
                    both sexes.[11] The young are often called chicks.

                    "Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.[12] The species as a whole was then called
                    domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens",
                    sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many
                    small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands). The word "chicken" is
                    sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females
                    being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used.

                    In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term
                    yardbird.[13]

                    General biology and habitat

                    Anatomy of a chicken.

                    In some breeds the adult rooster can be distinguished from the hen by his larger comb
                    Chickens are omnivores.[14] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects
                    and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes or young mice.[15]

                    The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[16] The world's oldest
                    known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness
                    World Records.[17]

                    Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and
                    shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of
                    brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as
                    the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the
                    hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of
                    spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be
                    differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or
                    cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively,
                    these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult
                    male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A muff
                    or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the
                    chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance
                    flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over
                    fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to
                    explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

                    Behavior

                    Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the
                    incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others,
                    establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and
                    nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this
                    social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an
                    existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[18] When a rooster finds food, he may call other
                    chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping
                    the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them
                    to eat.

                    A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other
                    roosters.[19] However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their
                    surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also
                    give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the
                    ground.[20]

                    Courtship
                    To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"),
                    often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.[21] The dance triggers a response in the
                    hen[21] and when she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the
                    mating.

                    More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1. Male approaching the hen. 2.
                    Male pre-copulatory waltzing. 3. Male waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping
                    aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet
                    on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).[22]

                    Nesting and laying behaviour

                    Chicken eggs vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of
                    brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) (Araucana varieties).

                    Chicks before their first outing
                    Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from
                    neighbouring nests into their own. The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few
                    preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird. Hens will often express a
                    preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the
                    same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined,
                    this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other. There is evidence that individual
                    hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.[23]

                    Broodiness
                    Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then
                    incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go broody". The broody hen will stop laying and
                    instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will
                    "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will
                    rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe. While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a
                    constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of
                    the incubation. To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest. To
                    discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.

                    Breeds artificially developed for egg production rarely go broody, and those that do often stop
                    part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the Cochin, Cornish and Silkie, do
                    regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those
                    of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such
                    as quail, pheasants, turkeys or geese.

                    Hatching and early life
                    Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.[21] Development of
                    the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other,
                    despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so. Before hatching, the hen can hear the
                    chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their
                    shells. The chick begins by "pipping"; pecking a breathing hole with its egg tooth towards the blunt
                    end of the egg, usually on the upper side. The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the
                    remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used
                    earlier for breathing through the shell). The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round
                    as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid. The chick
                    crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet down dries out in the warmth of the nest.

                    Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this
                    time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal yolk sac. Some breeds sometimes start
                    eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.[24] Hens fiercely guard their chicks, and brood them
                    when necessary to keep them warm, at first often returning to the nest at night. She leads them to
                    food and water and will cal
